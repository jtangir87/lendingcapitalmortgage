        <p>A Non QM Loan is any loan that does not meet the Qualified Mortgage requirements set forth by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. </p>

        <p>The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act imposed an obligation on lenders to make a good-faith effort to determine that the 
        applicants have the ability to repay the mortgage. This is known as the ability-to-repay (ATR) rule. The Act also mandates that QM loans cannot have 
        risky loan features like negative amortization, interest-only, balloon payments, terms beyond 30 years or excessive points and fees.</p>

        <p>A Qualified Mortgage loan must satisy at least one of the following:
          <ul>
            <li>Debt to Income ratio of 43% or less</li>
            <li>Loan would be eligible through the FHA, VA, USDA, or government sponsored enterprise programs</li>
            <li>Meet USDA monthly income caps</li>
            <li>Loan was originated by insured depositories with total assets less than $10 billion and must be held in portfolio for at least three years.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Any loan that does meet the above standards is categorized as a Non QM Loan.</p>
