          <h2>Conventional Loans</h2>
        </div>

          
        <p>A conventional loan is a mortgage loan that is not insured or guaranteed by the government. Instead, the loan is backed by private lenders, and it's insurance is usually paid by the borrower.</p>

        <p>Because conventional loans offer so much flexibility, there are still some decisions you have to make even after you choose this loan type. You’ll also have to consider how much you can put down (down payment), how long you want your loan term to be, and how much house you can afford.</p>

        <p>The conventional loan amount also has to be within conforming loan limits: up to $510,400 in most areas, but higher in some high-cost ZIP codes. If you apply for a conventional loan with better credentials — like a 740 or higher credit score and 20% down payment, for example — you’ll get access to lower rates and a lower monthly payment. </p>

        <p>Minimum Conventional Mortgage Loan Requirments:
          <ul>
            <li>Minimum credit score of 620</li>
            <li>Debt-to-income ratio lower than 43%</li>
            <li>Down payment of at least a 3%</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
